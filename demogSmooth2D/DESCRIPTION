Depends: R (>= 3.2.2), quantreg, compiler, lmtest, stats, rgl, colorspace
Description: The implemented method uses for smoothing bivariate thin plate splines, bivariate lasso-type regularization, and allows for both period and cohort effects. Thus the mortality rates are modelled as the sum of four components: a smooth bivariate function of age and time, smooth one-dimensional cohort effects, smooth one-dimensional period effects and random errors.
