Description: Mortality rates are modelled as the sum of four components; a smooth bivariate function of age and time, smooth one-dimensional cohort effects, smooth one-dimensional period effects, and random errors. The model uses bivariate thin plate splines, bivariate lasso-type regularization, and allows for both period and cohort effects.
